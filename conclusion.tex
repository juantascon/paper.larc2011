\section{Conclusion}

After the system was implemented and properly tested the following characteristics are emphasized:

\begin{itemize}
\item Entire stability and functionality of the Cantagallo generation
  center monitoring and remote control services. On account of the
  link stability and the conceived original design bringing both
  modularity and simplicity.
\item Human-machine interface gives the operator a simple control
  solution and a wide use of every device involved in the system.
\item The solution is effective and easy to implement because of two
  factors. The first is the following of the guidelines of an ideal
  automation system architecture, with special focus on modularity and
  robustness. And the second is the integration of every equipment into
  the Ethernet communication main bus.
\item The effective implemented automation at the generation centers
  enables the supervision at each instant in order to support and
  diagnose the system.
\item System modularity and the acquired experience with the supply,
  installation, programming and the come into service of the generation
  centers automation ease the further development of similar works in
  the national territory.
\end{itemize}
