  The following paper shows the birth and development of a
  distributed automation system at the Cantagallo and Yariguí
  electrical generation centers. An architecture based on MODBUS
  at the I/O devices layer and an Ethernet network as core for the
  communications is proposed. It is important to highlight that the
  Cantagallo center is operated remotely. System integration is
  implemented by a Vijeo Citect SCADA, there, the use of the several
  Modbus protocol versions is predominant at the generation centers
  hardware. It also shows the software involving the Quantum PLC
  programming, the HMI application and the SCADA which will be the
  main automation component. Currently the application is successfully
  working at the two ECOPETROL generation centers.
